"Biological descendants of ^#99BBFF;The Spirit Tree^reset; created via a unique asexual reproduction cycle. This cycle involves using a uniquely generated DNA template that has a select group of traits scrambled on the creation of a new guardian, simulating population diversity on a level unparalleled by conventional reproduction. Their origins are on a world known as \"Nibel\".
These creatures exhibit extreme agility and exceptional capabilities in navigating and remembering the layout of natural areas. Unfortunately, this agile nature comes with a limited capability in withstanding physical trauma as well as low tolerance for toxic elements.
